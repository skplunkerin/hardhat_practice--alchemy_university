# Alchemy University Hardhat Practice

This project practices:

1. Setting up a bare bones Hardhat Javascript project
2. Creating and deploying a Smart Contract on the Goerli testnet

## Sample Hardhat Project

> The following was generated from `npx hardhat`

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
